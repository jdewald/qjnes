HOWTO load test suite:
Start emulator at E39D
Load _start file
SYS 2049
RUN

**** LOADRAM interception ****
When using the test suite, it goes straight to F49E (load ram from a device)
That jumps to F4A5 after storing $C3 in X and $C4 in Y
F4AB It then checks the device number (which is set during a load) from $BA (must be something other than 0)
  -- 3 = keyboard
  -- 8 = device
F4B8 Checks length of current filename in $B7
F4BF Checks logical file number in $B9
;; F5AF display loading message...
F5AF Checks load mode from $9D (0x80 = direct, 0x00 = program)
F5B3 Calls F12F to show "searching"
F5C7 Reads and outputs filename from ($BB)

F4C8 Opens serial device by calling F3D5

F3FC - F404 - outputs filename to serial device 
Should find out filename and load from there

F4D5 Calls EE13 to read from device
F31F STA $BA
FE02   86 BA      STX $BA
