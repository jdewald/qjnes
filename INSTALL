General requirements:

---- [Commodore 64] ----
In order to use the Commodore 64 Emulator, you must obtain ROM files the Kernal,BASIC, Character ROM files.

Place them into the roms directory:

kernal.901227-03.bin
basic.901226-01.bin
characters.901225-01.bin

just doing 'ant run' will start up the C64


---- [NES] ----

'ant nes -Drom="<path to rom>" will fire up the NES Emulator with that ROM

More than likely it won't actually work ;)

Some successful ones:

Super Mario Brothers 3
