- think about putting operands and entire instruction into integer (which is 32 bits and so is quite plenty). This way we don't have to muck around with arrays
- should have one CIA.java with two instances
- CPUTimed interface (handleCycle())
- InstructionSet has array of cycle times 
- CPU should have an interrupt() method
- CPU should have nonMaskableInterrupt() method
- write a test for the Screen codes (go through the char rom and output everything)
- need to do addresses on stack in the same way that the real one does because it seems to be screwing with some of the methods
- move AddressingMode handling to InstructionSet or Instruction
- Have a MemoryBus? so that VIC can see different memory from others
- RAM and ROM should just be implementations of Memory (or
- ReadOnlyMemory and WriteableMemory)
- Add a save/restore state option
